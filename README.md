# jackin

`jackin` is a CLI for orchestrating AI coding agents at scale. Each agent runs in an isolated Docker container with Docker-in-Docker enabled — a self-contained world to think, build, and execute in. You're the Operator. They're already inside.

Reference: <https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/Jacking_in>

> **Current status:** jackin is built as a proof of concept around [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) as its first and only supported agent runtime. Support for additional agent runtimes — [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com) — is planned for future releases.

## Construct

`donbeave/jackin-construct:trixie` is the shared base image for every agent repo. In The Matrix, the construct is the base simulated environment you load before a mission. That maps directly to `jackin`'s shared runtime image: every agent starts from the same construct before layering on its own specialized environment.

## Commands

- `jackin load smith` — send an agent in.
- `jackin hardline agent-smith` — reattach to a running agent.
- `jackin eject agent-smith` — pull one agent out.
- `jackin eject smith --all` — pull every Smith out for one class scope.
- `jackin exile` — remove every running agent.
- `jackin purge smith --all` — delete persisted state for one class.

## Storage

- `~/.config/jackin/config.toml` — operator config.
- `~/.jackin/agents/...` — cached agent repositories.
- `~/.jackin/data/<container-name>/` — persisted `.claude`, `.claude.json`, and `plugins.json` for one agent instance.

## Agent Repo Contract

Each agent repo must contain:

- `jackin.agent.toml`
- a Dockerfile at the path declared by `jackin.agent.toml`

The manifest Dockerfile path must be relative and must stay inside the repo checkout.

Derived build-context generation currently rejects symlinks in the agent repo instead of following or preserving them.

The final Dockerfile stage must literally be `FROM donbeave/jackin-construct:trixie`, optionally with an alias such as `FROM donbeave/jackin-construct:trixie AS runtime`. Earlier stages may use any base image.

`smith`-style agent repos only own their agent-specific environment layer. `jackin` owns the runtime wiring around that layer: validating the repo contract, generating the derived Dockerfile, installing Claude into the derived image, injecting the runtime entrypoint, mounting the cached repo checkout at `/workspace`, mounting persisted `.claude`, `.claude.json`, and `plugins.json`, and wiring the per-agent Docker-in-Docker runtime.

## Roadmap

- [x] Claude Code agent runtime
- [ ] [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) agent runtime
- [ ] [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com) agent runtime
