# Commits, Branching & Contributing

## License

Apache 2.0. Contributions licensed under same terms (Section 5).

## DCO

All contributions signed off under [DCO v1.1](https://developercertificate.org/). Enforced by [DCO2 GitHub App](https://github.com/cncf/dco2) — unsigned commit blocks PR.

Employer contributions: confirm authorization before submitting. Use personal email in commit author + sign-off.

## How to Submit

1. Fork. Branch feature off `main`.
2. Change. Sign every commit: `git commit -s`.
3. Open PR describing problem solved. CI must pass.

## Branching

Never commit to `main`. All work on own branch.

Names: `feature/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, or `chore/` prefix + short lowercase hyphen description.

### Sync with main: merge by default

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge --no-ff origin/main -m "chore(merge): sync main into <branch>"
git push
```

When updating an active PR branch from `main`, use a normal merge commit by default. This preserves the branch's review history and avoids a force-push cycle.

Do not rebase, amend, squash, or otherwise rewrite the branch unless the operator explicitly approves that rewrite for the branch. If the merge has conflicts, resolve them in the merge commit and keep the subject conventional.

Recommended merge-sync subject:

```text
chore(merge): sync main into <branch>
```

## Commit Format

[Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Subject: `<type>[optional scope][!]: <desc>`, where scope is written as `(scope)`.

| Type | Use |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New user-visible feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Docs-only |
| `style` | Formatting, no logic |
| `refactor` | Restructure, no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance |
| `test` | Tests |
| `build` | Build/tooling/deps |
| `ci` | CI config |
| `chore` | Maintenance (release, merge-sync commits, deps) |
| `revert` | Reverts prior commit |

Breaking: `feat!:` or `feat(scope)!:` + `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. PR title = squash-merge subject — same rules.

## Signing

```sh
git commit -s -m "feat(scope): description"
git commit --amend -s --no-edit   # forgot -s → force-push after (operator approval required)
```

DCO fail on PR: fix first, before anything else.

## Merge-Readiness Check

Run when PR ready to merge (not before every commit):

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo check --all-targets
cargo nextest run --all-features
cargo nextest run -p jackin --features e2e --profile docker-e2e
```

Fmt fail → `cargo fmt`, re-check. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
