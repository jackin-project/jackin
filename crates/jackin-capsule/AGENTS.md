- `daemon.rs` decomposes, it does not grow: split production responsibility first, then move each subsystem's tests with it. Do not split `tests.rs` to cut line count.
- No blocking on the render/control path — blocking process/filesystem work goes through async helpers or `spawn_blocking` (also enforced by `clippy::disallowed_methods`).
- A wire-format change is a host↔capsule contract change: align both binaries in the same PR (types live in `jackin-protocol`).

## Boundaries

- The terminal *model* this daemon drives lives in `jackin-term` — capsule never recreates a second terminal model beside it.
