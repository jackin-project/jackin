## Status

- **Priority**: P1
- **Effort**: L
- **Risk**: MED
- **Depends on**: plans/unified-otel-observability/004-telemetry-facade-api.md, 005-async-spawn-helpers.md, 007-identity-lifecycle-roots.md
- **Roadmap item**: [Unified OpenTelemetry observability](../../docs/content/docs/roadmap/unified-otel-observability.mdx) (`docs/content/docs/roadmap/unified-otel-observability.mdx`) — this plan implements the "Execution and integration boundaries" case table (launch pipeline, subprocess, `jackin-exec`, Docker Engine, provider usage/API, binary download, usage database), the connection/config/trust/cache/isolation rows of "Product state and health", and the `error.type` failure-classification row; the roadmap item is the binding contract and overrides this plan on any conflict.
- **Planned at**: commit `fa8194882`, 2026-07-15

## Why this matters

The roadmap requires shared boundary instrumentation to land BEFORE leaf call sites migrate ("Ad hoc subprocess, Docker, HTTP, database, launch, and async instrumentation → shared boundary instrumentation using the explicit case contracts above before leaf call sites migrate"). One instrumented choke point per boundary means the hundreds of leaf sites in plan 011 become deletions, not rewrites. This plan instruments: the launch pipeline (one bounded operation, 11 stage children), subprocess execution, Docker Engine HTTP, provider HTTP, binary downloads, the usage SQLite DB, connection attempts, and config/trust/cache/isolation decision events — all with allowlisted attributes only.

## Current state

(verified at planning commit)

- **Launch stages**: `jackin_core::LaunchStage` (`crates/jackin-core/src/launch_progress.rs:16-39`) — exactly 11 variants `Identity, Role, Credentials, Construct, AgentBinaries, DerivedImage, Workspace, Network, Sidecar, Capsule, Hardline`; `ALL: [Self; 11]` at `:43`. Stage transitions are split across two mechanisms: `StepCounter` (`crates/jackin-runtime/src/runtime/launch/progress_helpers.rs:30`, text→stage map at `:144`) and direct `progress.stage_done/stage_skipped` calls in `launch_pipeline.rs` (`:74,433,954,1029,1057-1060,1201`), `orchestrate.rs` (`:946,950,1440,1479,1521,1789`), `launch_runtime.rs` (`:1086,1184`). Parallel legacy telemetry via `active_timing_started/done(DiagnosticStage…)`. The launch future is already wrapped by `launch_trace` (`crates/jackin/src/app/load_cmd.rs:127,406,456` → `jackin-diagnostics/src/screen.rs:255`) — a screen-trace mechanism plan 009 removes; the launch OPERATION span this plan adds replaces its causal role.
- **Subprocess**: pure transport `crates/jackin-process/src/lib.rs` (`ExecRequest` `:49-179`, `ExecResult { code, success, … }` `:183`, `exec_async` `:202`); its crate doc says "explicitly NOT telemetry (callers own it)". The instrumented caller today is `crates/jackin-docker/src/shell_runner.rs` (`enter_process_execute` at `:257` uses the OLD operation facade with `process.command` + redacted args — 4 call sites of `jackin-diagnostics` operation API). Known executables across callers: `git` ×22, `docker` ×22, `gh` ×4, `op` ×2, `mise` ×2, `ps` ×2, plus `codex`, Apple `container`, `sh`, `osascript` (`host_daemon.rs:655`, `jackin-host/src/host_clipboard.rs:321,360,387`), pagers, agent binaries.
- **Docker Engine**: bollard 0.21 client `crates/jackin-docker/src/docker_client.rs` — `BollardDockerClient` implementing `DockerApi` (`jackin-core/src/docker.rs:134`); ~16 methods (`ping :330`, `inspect_container_state :338`, `create_container :441`, `pull_image :603`, `exec_capture :620`, …). Contract: HTTP client conventions over Unix socket — `http.request.method`, bounded `url.template`, `outcome`, `error.type`, target `container.id` when applicable; `server.address` omitted (socket path is user-specific); container names/image refs/labels omitted.
- **Provider HTTP** (`crates/jackin-usage`): reqwest blocking; `fetch_claude_oauth_usage` (`usage/claude.rs:825`, api.anthropic.com), `fetch_codex_oauth_usage` (`usage/codex.rs:883`, chatgpt.com backend), `fetch_amp_api_usage` (`usage/amp.rs:214`), `fetch_grok_web_billing` (`usage/grok.rs:446`), plus zai/kimi/minimax/refresh modules. Contract: HTTP client conventions + registry `gen_ai.provider.name` ∈ {anthropic, openai, amp, xai, zai, minimax, kimi}; no account id, auth material, URL query, response body, or arbitrary model string.
- **Binary download / version check**: `crates/jackin-image/src/agent_binary.rs` (release metadata refresh `:180`, retry/backoff `:660,694`) and `capsule_binary.rs`. Contract: HTTP conventions, bounded route template, server authority, `cache.result`, outcome, error type; no full URL/local path/headers/content.
- **Usage DB**: turso SQLite via `crates/jackin-usage/src/store_backend.rs` (`connect_local :10`); ops in `telemetry_store.rs` — `BEGIN :283`, `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE :289-319`, `COMMIT :380`, `ROLLBACK :374`, selects `:740,:819`. Contract: `db.system.name=sqlite`, bounded `db.operation.name` ∈ {begin, select, insert, upsert, update, delete} as actually called, `db.client.operation.duration` histogram; no SQL text, DB path, account id, provider response. (The `telemetry_store` RENAME is plan 013.)
- **Connections**: host→daemon (`host_daemon.rs:370`), host→capsule control/attach (`client.rs:62,527`, `host_attach.rs:115`, probes `attach.rs:107,199` with retry/backoff at `attach.rs:192`), capsule→host exec (`exec.rs:147,291`), Docker ping. Contract: one `connection.attempt` trace per attempt with `connection.peer.type` ∈ {host_daemon, capsule_control, capsule_attach, docker, provider, parallax}; retry scheduling is a WARN log; reconnects are new attempts.
- **Config/migration**: `crates/jackin-config` — `versions.rs:11-15` (`v1alpha9` global / `v1alpha8` workspace), migration chains `migrations.rs:43-136`. Contract: `config.scope`, `config.operation`, schema from/to + step count, outcome, `error.type`; no path/workspace name/key/value.
- **Trust / isolation / cache**: trust decisions in config/trust command paths (`crates/jackin/src/app/config_cmd.rs` + `jackin-manifest` trust checks — locate via `grep -rn "trusted" crates/jackin-config/src crates/jackin-manifest/src --include='*.rs' -l`); isolation/egress at launch-plan/application boundaries (`crates/jackin-isolation`, `orchestrate.rs` network stage `:1479`, fail-closed firewall apply `launch_runtime.rs:995-1030`); cache decisions currently ad-hoc (`jackin.cache.hits/misses` metric + `feature.decision` events). Contract rows: trust.decision/trust.source.type; workspace.isolation.mode/network.mode/dind.mode with one failure event on fail-closed firewall; cache.name ∈ {role_repository, agent_binary, capsule_binary, derived_image, usage_snapshot} × cache.result ∈ {hit, miss, stale, reuse, bypass}.
- **error.type registry**: `crates/jackin/src/error.rs:16-33` `ErrorCode` E001–E016; schema names from plan 001 (e.g. E001→`docker_daemon_unreachable`, E016→`unsupported_otlp_protocol`), plus `timeout`, `connection_refused`, `panic`.

## Commands you will need

| Purpose | Command | Expected on success |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace | `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features --locked` | all pass |
| Launch benches still build | `cargo check -p jackin-runtime --benches --locked` | exit 0 |
| Conformance | `cargo nextest run -p jackin-diagnostics -p jackin-capsule --all-features --locked -E 'test(/conformance/)'` | all pass |
| Lint + spawn/telemetry gates | `cargo xtask ci --only lint` | exit 0 |
| Manual smoke | `cargo run --bin jackin -- doctor --debug` | passes; no behavior change |

## Scope

**In scope:**
- `crates/jackin-runtime/src/runtime/launch/` — launch operation + stage children (`launch_pipeline.rs`, `orchestrate.rs`, `launch_runtime.rs`, `progress_helpers.rs`)
- `crates/jackin-docker/src/shell_runner.rs` (subprocess CLIENT span via new facade) and `docker_client.rs` (Docker HTTP spans — wrap the `DockerApi` impl methods; a decorator struct implementing `DockerApi` around `BollardDockerClient` is the cleanest single choke point)
- `crates/jackin-process/src/lib.rs` — **no telemetry added here** (T0 transport stays clean); instead, audit non-ShellRunner callers and route their spans at the call-site boundary helpers in the owning crates (`jackin-host` caffeinate/clipboard, `jackin-image` binaries, `jackin-env` op_cli, capsule `util.rs`/`pr_context.rs`)
- `crates/jackin-usage/src/usage/*.rs` — one shared instrumented HTTP helper (provider requests) + DB op wrapper in `store_backend.rs`
- `crates/jackin-image/src/agent_binary.rs`, `capsule_binary.rs` — download/version-check spans + cache events
- Connection attempt spans at the client connect sites listed above
- Config/trust/isolation/cache events in `jackin-config`, `jackin-isolation`, launch path
- `crates/jackin/src/error.rs` — `impl ErrorCode { pub fn telemetry_error_type(self) -> &'static str }` mapping to schema constants (compile-time exhaustive)
- Schema registry additions (plan 001's YAML + regen): span defs `launch`, `launch.stage.*` naming, `process.command`, `connection.attempt`, HTTP/DB instrument defs, decision event defs

**Out of scope:**
- TUI/action wiring (plan 009), capsule cycles/PTY/agent status (plan 010), prewarm PRODUCER/CONSUMER (plan 010).
- Deleting `active_timing_*`/`run.stage` legacy calls — they coexist until plan 013 (removal) / plan 011 (call-site migration) drain them.
- `LaunchProgress` UI behavior (in-memory progress state is product UI, stays).

## Git workflow

- Branch: `feature/unified-otel-observability` — single branch, single PR for the whole roadmap item (plans 001–015 together); no per-plan branch or separate PR. Conventional Commits per boundary commit (e.g. `feat(runtime): bounded launch operation with stage child spans`). Sign `-s`, push after every commit.

## Steps

### Step 1: Launch operation + stage children

Create the bounded launch operation at the single entry (`launch_role_runtime` callers' top — practical anchor: where `launch_trace` wraps today, `load_cmd.rs:127/406/456`; replace the wrapper's telemetry role with a facade operation span `launch` carrying `launch.target.kind` (∈ workspace|directory — derive from the selector kind already known at that site), `outcome`, `error.type` on terminal failure via `ErrorCode::telemetry_error_type`). Give `LaunchProgress`'s stage transitions a telemetry twin: in `progress_helpers.rs`/the direct-call sites, open a child span per stage (`launch.stage.name=<stage>`) at `stage_started` and close at `stage_done/skipped/failed` (skipped ⇒ `outcome=skip`; failed ⇒ Error + `error.type`). Since stage calls are scattered, add one helper owned by the launch module (`fn stage_span(stage: LaunchStage) -> OperationGuard2`) and call it from the same places `progress.stage_*` fire — a table-driven audit: every `LaunchStage::ALL` member must appear; add the cross-crate equality test LaunchStage↔schema enum here (deferred from plan 001 step 4).

**Verify**: `cargo nextest run -p jackin-runtime --locked` → pass; new in-memory-export test asserts a launch produces one `launch` span + N stage children all parented to it, none open at the end.

### Step 2: Subprocess boundary

In `shell_runner.rs`, swap the old operation facade calls (4 sites, `enter_process_execute :257`, exit-code recording `:98`) to the new facade: `process.command` CLIENT span; attributes `process.executable.name` (basename only), `process.exit.code`, `outcome`, `error.type`; **omit argv, command line, cwd, executable path** (the old `process.args_redacted` attr is NOT carried over — prohibited by the contract). `jackin-exec` flows (capsule `input_dispatch.rs` exec path) additionally set executable classification `configured_command` and must never attach operator command/args/stdout/stderr. For non-ShellRunner subprocess callers, add a tiny `instrumented_exec` wrapper in each owning crate that wraps `jackin_process::exec_async` with the same span shape, and migrate those callers (locate: `grep -rn "jackin_process::\|exec_async\|exec_sync" crates/ --include='*.rs' | grep -v "jackin-process/src\|tests.rs"`).

**Verify**: workspace tests pass; new test asserts span for a fake runner call carries executable name but no argv attr.

### Step 3: Docker Engine boundary

Decorator `InstrumentedDockerApi<C: DockerApi>` in `jackin-docker`: per method, CLIENT span with `http.request.method` + bounded `url.template` (hand-written per method: e.g. `/containers/{id}/json`, `/images/create`), Unix transport attrs, `container.id` where the method targets one, `outcome`, `error.type` (map bollard errors: connect-refused → `connection_refused`, timeouts → `timeout`, daemon-down → `docker_daemon_unreachable`). Install the decorator at client construction (`BollardDockerClient::connect` callers). Never attach container name, image reference, or labels.

**Verify**: `cargo nextest run -p jackin-docker --locked` → pass (FakeDockerClient in jackin-test-support keeps working — decorator is transparent); template test: each method's `url.template` is a static, brace-parameterized string.

### Step 4: Provider HTTP + downloads + DB

- One `provider_request` helper in `jackin-usage` (wraps the blocking reqwest calls): HTTP CLIENT span, `gen_ai.provider.name` from the registry, `http.request.method`, bounded `url.template` (per provider endpoint, no query), `outcome`, `error.type`. Migrate the fetch functions listed in Current state to route through it. Assert no header/body/account-id attributes.
- `jackin-image` downloads: same HTTP shape + `cache.name`/`cache.result` events (`agent_binary`/`capsule_binary` caches) at the existing hit/miss decision points.
- DB: wrap execute/query in `store_backend.rs` with `db.client.operation.duration` histogram + span per op, `db.system.name=sqlite`, `db.operation.name` derived from the statement kind at the call site (pass an enum, don't parse SQL).

**Verify**: `cargo nextest run -p jackin-usage -p jackin-image --locked` → pass; privacy negative test: a provider span exported from a test request contains no `authorization`, no URL query, no account id.

### Step 5: Connection attempts + decision events

- `connection.attempt` root/child spans (per the trace-shape table: a connection attempt is its own bounded trace when detached from an operation, or a child when synchronous inside one — the probes with retry loops at `runtime/attach.rs:192` produce one attempt-trace per iteration and a WARN retry-scheduled log between) with `connection.peer.type`; wire at: daemon client connect, capsule control/attach connect, exec host.sock connect, Docker ping.
- Config events at load/validate/migrate/save choke points in `jackin-config` (the migration chain runner in `migrations.rs` knows from/to/steps). Trust decision events where trust is granted/revoked/rejected. Isolation/egress decision events at the launch-plan boundary (`workspace.isolation.mode`, `network.mode`, `dind.mode` are all known in the launch plan structs) + the single fail-closed firewall failure event at the `docker exec` firewall-apply failure path (`launch_runtime.rs:995-1030`).

**Verify**: targeted tests per event (fields exactly per contract rows; no mount path/host/workspace/role/container name fields — assert absence).

### Step 6: Conformance sweep

Extend the conformance group: every span/event added in this plan appears in the schema registry; `error.type` values on exported signals ⊆ schema enum; a full fake launch produces the documented shape (launch + 11 stages + subprocess + docker children in one trace).

**Verify**: `cargo nextest run -p jackin-diagnostics -p jackin-capsule --all-features --locked -E 'test(/conformance/)'` → pass; regenerate export-volume ratchet (counts change): `cargo nextest run -p jackin-diagnostics --all-features -E 'test(conformance_export_volume)'` + `cargo xtask lint ratchet --print export-volume` → update `ratchet.toml`.

## Reopened audit additions (2026-07-16)

- Inventory long-lived streams and watchers. Trace bounded open, handshake, control, and close operations with truthful outcomes, while proving no stream/watcher lifetime span exists.
- Emit launch-stage/cache and connection count, active, and duration metrics at the shared boundary choke points with only their bounded dimensions.
- Capsule runtime setup now routes captured, null-output, and optional synchronous commands through one `process.command` owner. Isolation Git inspection uses the same shape. The shared runtime sync/async owner now covers `jackin-exec` credential resolution, host notification dispatch, every Apple-container exec/list/lifecycle/readiness/version/attach command, and parallel workspace Git pulls; the unused raw-child Apple attach API is gone. Spawn failures are sanitized at the owner, and failure paths no longer retain stderr, program/argument material, repository/container/image names, mounts, environment values, focus IDs, or exit details in error text or generic telemetry. A focused matrix proves success, nonzero, spawn, and timeout outcomes plus stdout/stderr/program/argument privacy; a production Git-pull exporter test also proves joined OS-thread dispatcher/span propagation. Continue migrating snapshot, Docker attach, and host-liveness commands through the runtime owner.

## Test plan

- Launch shape test (step 1), subprocess privacy test (step 2), Docker template/decorator tests (step 3), provider/DB privacy + shape tests (step 4), decision-event field tests (step 5), conformance sweep (step 6).
- Perf guard: `cargo bench -p jackin-runtime --bench launch_pipeline -- --quick` completes; plan 014 enforces the ±5% budget — here just confirm no obvious regression (compare quick numbers to a pre-change run if the harness makes it easy; otherwise rely on plan 014).
- Model integration tests on existing launch tests in `crates/jackin-runtime/src/runtime/launch/tests.rs` and FakeRunner/FakeDockerClient from `jackin-test-support`.

## Done criteria

- [ ] `cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features --locked` exits 0
- [ ] Launch trace shape test passes (1 launch span, 11 possible stage children, correct parentage)
- [ ] `grep -rn "process.args_redacted" crates/ --include='*.rs' | grep -v "jackin-diagnostics\|tests.rs"` → no new-facade usage (legacy sites remain until plans 011/013)
- [ ] Privacy negatives pass (no argv/URL-query/account-id/SQL-text/container-name attrs)
- [ ] `cargo xtask lint --strict` exits 0 (ratchet regenerated)
- [ ] `plans/unified-otel-observability/README.md` status row updated

## STOP conditions

Stop and report back (do not improvise) if:
- Launch stage start/done call sites cannot be paired reliably for some stage (the split StepCounter/direct-call mechanisms drifted) — report the unpairable stage with file:line instead of guessing.
- The `DockerApi` trait has `&self` methods that make a decorator impossible without arch-tier violations.
- Provider request functions turn out to stream bodies through the helper in a way that would buffer sensitive payloads to build attributes — attributes must be derivable without touching the body; report if not.
- Any contract row requires an attribute the schema (plan 001) lacks — schema first, never an inline literal.

## Maintenance notes

- Plan 011 deletes the parallel `active_timing_*`/`run.stage` calls at these same sites; the twin-emission overlap is temporary and intentional.
- New Docker/provider endpoints must add a `url.template` — reviewer should reject any `format!`-built template.
- The `ErrorCode::telemetry_error_type` mapping is the single E-code→`error.type` authority; `main.rs` error rendering and plan 012's validate command both read it.
