# Pull Request Merging

**Agents must never merge a pull request without explicit per-PR confirmation from the human operator.**

- Open the PR, share the URL, and stop. The default response after creating a PR is "PR URL — ready for your review" — not a merge command in the same turn.
- Prior "just do it" / "don't wait for me" / "proceed autonomously" / "merge silently" authorizations apply only to the specific workstream the operator was discussing when they issued them. They do not carry forward to later PRs in the same session or to new sessions. Treat each PR as a fresh approval gate.
- `--admin` / branch-protection bypass is a privilege, not a default. Use it only when the operator explicitly authorizes merging *this specific PR*.
- Phrasing that does NOT authorize merge (ask anyway): "proceed", "don't wait for me", "do everything autonomously", "looks good". Phrasing that does: "merge it", "merge this one", "you can merge now", "ship it" (still prefer to confirm "ship = merge now?" for high-blast-radius PRs).
- Bounded authorization: if the operator says "merge all the PRs we just discussed" or similar, merge only the named set — not unrelated PRs that exist or that you open later.

If you are uncertain whether authorization applies to the PR in front of you, ask. The cost of pausing is ~30 seconds; the cost of merging something the operator wasn't ready for is much higher.
